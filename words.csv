actress,actor,"Actress comes into the same category as authoress, comedienne, manageress, 'lady doctor', 'male nurse' and similar obsolete terms that date from a time when professions were largely the preserve of one sex (usually men). The Screen Actors Guild Awards honour the best male actor and best female actor, while the Oscars go to best actors and actresses."

career woman,"professional, manager, executive","A senior editor at one of the world's leading business magazine groups, Forbes, advised readers to “[m]arry pretty women or ugly ones. Short ones or tall ones. Blondes or brunettes. Just, whatever you do, don’t marry a woman with a career.” Think that article is from the 1950s. You’re wrong. It was published in 2006. The term  ""career woman"" is a relic of the Women's Liberation Movement fifty years ago, when a woman who sought a career was an anomaly or judged for making what many believed to be a radical political statement of feminism. "
chairman,"chair, chairperson, convenor","If you don’t think the term Chairman makes a difference to your view of what this person would look like, then close your eyes and repeat the word Chairman a couple of times and see what image comes to you.

fisherman,"fisher, fish harvester, fish industry worker, fishing licensees","In the late 1990s,  federal efforts to replace fisherman with fisher in Canadian government documents, coupled with a high-profile Supreme Court decision on native fishing rights, caused a riptide of dissent over what to call people who fish. There is still not an entirely satisfactory substitute for fisherman, although fisher, fish harvester, fish industry worker, fishing licensees or the phrase fishermen and women are all possibilities."
