Gender-neutralise app: let's make the world a fairer and gender neutral place for everyone.

User stories
* check whether a word is gender neutral
* if it isn't, return me the gender neutral equivalent of the gender-biased word I entered
* add some notes, if necessary, or even a 'did you know'  about the word or its use
* be able to look up all words beginning with a letter of the alphabet and see their gender neutral equivalent(s)
* can't find the word you're looking for, add one yourself
* update search results with new information ie a new gender neutral term that's being commonly used
* test yourself (game)

MVP
* a database of the most used gender-biased words and their gender-neutral eqivalent(s) (and include any necessary notes or tidbits about the word or its use). Need to think about plural options as well.
* search box on front page to enter word
* hit enter on your search field and the gender neutral equivalent(s) appears (including any notes)
* if the word you searched is already gender neutral (a message congratulating you)
* select a letter of the alphabet and a page directs you to all the gender-biased words starting with that letter and their gender neutral equivalent(s)

Stretch
* add, edit and update
* develop a game which tests users on their knowledge of gender-neutral equivalents to gender biased terms (get points?)
